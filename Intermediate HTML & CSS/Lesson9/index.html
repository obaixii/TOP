    <h4>Static - The static position is the default position of elements</h4>
    <h4>Relative - The relative position is fairly same as static, but with little change in behavior. <br>
        The difference between static and relative is fairly simple. Static is the default position of every element,
        and
        properties top, right, bottom, and left do not affect the position of the element. Relative on the other hand is
        pretty much the same as static, but properties top, right...(etc.
    </h4>
    <h4>Absolute - the absolute position allows you to position something at an exact point on the screen without
        disturbing the other elements around it. </h4>

    <h4>Fixed - Fixed elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document and are positioned relative to the
        viewport.</h4>

    <h4>Sticky - Sticky elements will act like normal elements until you scroll past them, then they start behaving like
        fixed elements.</h4>
